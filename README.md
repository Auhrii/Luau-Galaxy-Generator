# Results
Some of the generated galaxies are shown below; the first two screenshots were taken after star types were added, and the other two images are from before, but give a sense of the kinds of galaxy clusters that can be generated.

# Oopsies
A mistake in translating between global to local coordinates produced these interesting results. Whilst they're not what I was going for, I kept this as a feature toggle (wackyMode) - this is a number, as opposed to a boolean, as it also affects generation scale.
